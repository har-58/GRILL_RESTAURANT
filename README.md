This project is a restaurant-themed website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on frontend development. The webpage is designed to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience while maintaining a simple and intuitive interface.  

The website showcases various sections, including a menu, an about page, and a contact page, making it a great starting point for frontend development enthusiasts. Additionally, it incorporates basic code snippets that explain fundamental coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping students understand key concepts and enhance their programming skills.  

Although this project currently focuses on the frontend, it has the potential to be expanded into a full-stack application by integrating React.js for enhanced UI components and incorporating backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for dynamic content management.  

This project serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for further development, allowing students to explore web technologies and create more advanced versions with added functionality.
